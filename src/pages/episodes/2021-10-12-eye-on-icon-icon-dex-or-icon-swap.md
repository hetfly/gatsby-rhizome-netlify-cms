  Today I sit down with Alex and Ted, who have been building vibravid to talk to
  them about their new project they are proposing to get built on Icon 

  Icon dex or Icon swap? the name is undecided.


  Definitely one to listen to to learn the difference between this project and an AMM.


  Later in the interview Alex and Ted talk about how they can offer ram up services for teams building- Exactly what Icon needs! 
topics: Icon Dex, Icon swap
